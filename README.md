# CoverVidMaker
A C++ console program to convert MP3 audio files to MP4 videos using album covers.

Currently exclusive to developers (runs through Visual Studio).

This project was originally a series of Batch scripts created on June 4th, 2023.

## Features
- Highly customizable, extensible, and modular (from a developer perspective).
- Much easier to work with compared to batch scripts.
- Achieves desired results with just a single click.
- No restrictions on the number of files or video duration.

## Alternatives
- [**Online Converter**](https://www.onlineconverter.com/mp3-to-mp4): Limited to single file processing.
- [**Wondershare UniConverter**](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/convert-mp4/mp3-to-mp4-with-image.html): Free version has many restrictions (e.g. duration limits).
