Add checking for zero length file generated and fix
->  seems to do with covers above 1000x1000




Sanitize strings , prevent these from crashing:
Kanako Itō - Hacking to the Gate
Yuko Ogura - Girls ♥ Boys
and upload!







Improve duration process
Duration command wrapper (but still takes ffprobe as normal)










Add inheritance for learning ! 
- Check CPP learning !
- Mutable command
	- Check , must have mutable , can do in constructor







### ESTIMATING TIME
Do simple only (overall prediction at start)

Use chatgpt to check correlation based on 50 files results
Check which formula best fits , exponential , quadratic etc
From one duration to time needed

Create estimator in gen constructor
- Give media files temporarily
- Give file num and save it 
- Create list of index+duration+time_taken

print update takes with index and time taken 
printUpdate(  1/3 message + estimator.getEstimate(i, timeTaken));

Calculate estimates
- Duration / genFavtor = time it will take
- If gen factor is very high like with covers , don’t print estimates
- using time taken scaling with duration, Linearly
- Also use to calculate how long it will take for ALL files to be generated



If slow =  Try nvidia acceleration options?
