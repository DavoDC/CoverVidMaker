See notes in code.



Move all initialization code to FileProcessor



Continue CVM
Do one file at ?rst
File checker
File processor
For every media ?le , media
file.getAudio , getCover   




ask gpt to run long ffmpeg command via command class

when doing ffmpeg commands in a loop , you dont want to regen entire array every time
so add a function to command like  
replaceArg(“old arg”, “new arg”)  , finds old arg in the array and updates it.
you will have to save previous value or  use i switch etc
