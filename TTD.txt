1_EXTRACT_COVERS
- A model script, the others should be like this!

2_GENERATE_VIDEOS, 3_ADD_VIDEO_TRACK, 3 TRIM VIDEOS
- Make it work with new folder structure
- Combine, use ffmpeg call from 3!!!  
- Add info about must have video track to upload to YouTube
- Add more error/case checking

- Combine the last three scripts into one, 
its okay if doesn't work, will post to forum ,  post short version with no conditionals or error checking for ease 

- Make video generation step generate videos with video track and right length
(both desired qualities in one, instead of over 2 steps)
-> BEST WAY TO DO THIS:
- Post on a forum about duration issue - reddit
    - Post in https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/
    - Comment on https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/comments/vbsij8/youtube_is_rejecting_the_mp4_videos_ive_created/
