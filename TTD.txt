Try  nvidia acceleration options?




### ESTIMATOR
Create estimator in gen constructor
- Give media files temporarily
- Give file num and save it 
- Create list of index+duration+time_taken

print update takes with index and time taken 
printUpdate(  1/3 message + estimator.getEstimate(i, timeTaken));

Calculate estimates
- Duration / genFavtor = time it will take
- If gen factor is very high like with covers , don’t print estimates
- using time taken scaling with duration, Linearly
- Also use to calculate how long it will take for ALL files to be generated
