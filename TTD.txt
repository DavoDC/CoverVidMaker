See notes in code.


Put each of the three stages in separate classes

AudioFileProcessor
    Holds count
    Holds paths
    Get paths without extension

Generator - Use parent generator with commonalities like exec paths
    Cover Gen
    VideoGen



ask gpt to run long ffmpeg command via command class

when doing ffmpeg commands in a loop , you dont want to regen entire array every time
so add a function to command like  
replaceArg(“old arg”, “new arg”)  , finds old arg in the array and updates it.
you will have to save previous value or  use i switch etc




### AFTER EVERYTHING WORKING:
For the few vids that were uploaded , except for hackRoots coz thats fine:
- Save descriptions (e.g. OPM_DESC.txt)
- Remove 
Upload proper videos from fixed project
