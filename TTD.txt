Write combined powershell script reset for extra . Lists options with counts

At start, print info line .

Add duration to media files . Do in media file constructor!!!!! Do during scan . Use its own input audio string variable

Print total duration and file count

Use chatgpt to check correlation based on 50 files results
Check which formula best fits , exponential , quadratic etc

From one duration to time needed




Add file name and duration to output



Sanitize strings , prevent these from crashing:
Kanako Itō - Hacking to the Gate
Yuko Ogura - Girls ♥ Boys



Try  nvidia acceleration options?




### ESTIMATOR
Create estimator in gen constructor
- Give media files temporarily
- Give file num and save it 
- Create list of index+duration+time_taken

print update takes with index and time taken 
printUpdate(  1/3 message + estimator.getEstimate(i, timeTaken));

Calculate estimates
- Duration / genFavtor = time it will take
- If gen factor is very high like with covers , don’t print estimates
- using time taken scaling with duration, Linearly
- Also use to calculate how long it will take for ALL files to be generated
