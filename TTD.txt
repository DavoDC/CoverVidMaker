use c++20 starts with ends with
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/starts_withhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/starts_with

Use static constants for mutable args , like "INPUT_AUDIO"


make Run command returns time taken!!! 
Pass up time taken thru function obj 



Add duration calculation in Media files
Check how long duration command takes first
May be able to remove from generator:
    /**
     * @brief ffprobe.exe file path
    */
    const std::string ffprobePath;



Add timing like RA - time taken  , and then later time estimate
	- try to integrate into print upadte
	- may hav to disable for covers



Create estimator in gen constructor
- Give media files temporarily
- Give file num and save it 
- Create list of index+duration+time_taken


print update takes with index and time taken 
printUpdate(  1/3 message + estimator.getEstimate(i, timeTaken));


Calculate estimates
- Duration / genFavtor = time it will take
- If gen factor is very high like with covers , donâ€™t print estimates
- using time taken scaling with duration, Linearly
- Also use to calculate how long it will take for ALL files to be generated



Verbose output for videos only , add finish message 
No / messages for covers , except at end



Run cppcheck and code analysis




### WHEN FINISHED 
For the few vids that were uploaded , except for hackRoots coz thats fine:
- Save descriptions (e.g. OPM_DESC.txt)
- Remove 
Upload proper videos from fixed project 

do other ones like DHMIS
